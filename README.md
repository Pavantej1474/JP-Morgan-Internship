In October 2023, I participated in the J.P. Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience on Forage. I set up a local development environment by downloading the required files, tools, and dependencies. I also repaired broken files in the repository to ensure the web application functioned correctly. Additionally, I utilized JPMorgan Chase's open-source library, Perspective, to create a live graph that visualizes a data feed, enabling traders to monitor it in a clear and visually appealing manner.
